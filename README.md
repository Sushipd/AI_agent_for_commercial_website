# AI Agent for Commercial Website

## AI Product Chatbot & Image Search

A web-based **AI chatbot** that provides **product recommendations** via both **text queries** and **image uploads**.  
It supports a variety of products such as **grocery items**, **jeans**, **sofas**, **T-shirts**, and **TVs**, with **dynamic carousels**.

## üåü Features

- **Text-based product recommendation**  
  Ask the chatbot about products like ‚ÄúI want apples‚Äù or ‚ÄúShow me sofas‚Äù.

- **Image-based product search**  
  Upload a product image and get visually similar matches.

- **Hybrid chatbot engine**  
  Intent recognition for greetings, thanks, capabilities, and fallback  
  Combines intent recognition, keyword matching, and embedding similarity for flexible responses.


- **Product carousels**  
  Visualize products for static categories and grocery items.

The system combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **FastAPI-based web services** to provide intelligent product recommendations.

## System Architecture


1. **Frontend Interface**  
   - Users can send text queries or upload images.  
   - Results are displayed dynamically as product carousels.  

2. **FastAPI Backend (`main.py`)**  
   - Handles both `/recommend` (text query) and `/image-search` (image upload) endpoints.  
   - Returns structured JSON responses to the frontend.  

3. **AI Agent (`chat_agent.py`)**  
  
   Implements a Hybrid AI pipeline combining intent classification, NLP, and image-based retrieval.

   - Text Processing: 
      Uses SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic similarity and category matching. 
      Employs DialoGPT-small for natural fallback and conversational responses.
      Performs rule-based keyword matching, intent detection, and synonym normalization across product categories.
   - Image Analysis:
      Uses a pretrained ResNet-18 CNN backbone (from torchvision.models) for image embeddings.
      Compares uploaded images against a preloaded dataset to find visually similar items.
   - Product Knowledge Base:
      Loads grocery and e-commerce product data from a CSV file and static image directories.
      Dynamically computes and caches image embeddings for efficiency.

4. **Response Handler**  
   - Classifies output type (`string_response`, `dict_response`, or `exception`)  
   - Enables seamless communication between the AI logic and the frontend.

| `/`             | GET    | None                        | HTML page                                                | Serves the frontend `index.html` if available             |
| `/ping`         | GET    | None                        | {"status": "ok"}                                         | Health check endpoint                                     |
| `/recommend`    | POST   | {"text": "I want apples"}   | {"text": "...", "products": [...]}                       | Returns product recommendations based on a text query     |
| `/image-search` | POST   | Image file (via form-data)  | {"text": "...", "products": [...], "condition": "..."}   | Returns visually similar products from the uploaded image |
